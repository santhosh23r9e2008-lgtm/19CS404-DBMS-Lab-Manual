# Experiment 6: Joins

## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
